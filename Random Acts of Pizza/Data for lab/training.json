I get in there, and the HR manager explains that they \"Tried to reach me yesterday\" to tell me not to come in. Unfortunately they did not email nor did I have a message on my phone from them, so I just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview I showed up for and didn't even fucking get.\n\nPizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point. Moreso I'm just really, really hungry and haven't been able to eat well lately.

Awesomely!\n\nI'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. This is terrifying. Pizza (and maybe a salad, so I don't feel godawful fat.

So, I am proposing a magnificent trade- I will finish the scarf that I just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. Or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off NOW, because I already have drawings of those. Both are pretty awesome.\n\n[Half-finished scarf](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/c1Gax.jpg)\n(I'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. Right now it's just about exactly two feet. Full disclosure, I did learn to crochet right before I started it, so the beginning isn't great. If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. I can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. Stripes are way better. Anyway. Those are your options. I could totally do a bitchin' Slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black\/silver\/gray one, or... your options are endless)\n\n[Penguin](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hGWpS.jpg)\n\n[Abrictosaurus](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PDy9R.jpg)","45":"So after my bf shattered his ankle this morning we had to go to the ER and pay for the visit the xrays the crutches and the pain meds.

He lost 30% of his body weight and as a result his temperature also dropped a whopping 8 degrees F below normal.\n\n\nWe spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.\n\n\n\nHe needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.\n\n\n\nIf he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too\/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  This was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24\/7 monitoring.  The vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  After we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.  Pizza wold be wonderful.","75":"all alone at a yard sale thats not mine. havent sold anything yet....  and i have to watch everything so it dont get stolen. dinnertime coming up and food is scarce. plz help if you can","76":"A redditor friend of mine told me about this sub-reddit.

I love reading other people's pizza'd experience. \n\nI started a new job as a baker for Stop n Shop after not having a steady one for the past three years.

Not to mention the fact that I dropped the container spilling i....)\n\nwow I just realized how many food related accidents I've had today. Anyways I dropped the container and spilt melted icecream all over the kitchen floor. But at that point I didn't care because my bagel was done. It burned in the toaster. Hurt but not knocked down I scraped the black off the bagel and put some delicious salmon cream cheese on it (if you don't have salmon cream cheese get some it sounds extremely gross, but is actually pretty decent). Finally my little brother (14) tried to snatch my bagel out of my hands. He knocked it into the air luckily I bobbled it enough to regain control of my delicious snack. Unfortunately, I also bobbled cream cheese all over my arms and face. but fear not! I took revenge by sneaking up on him from behind and slapping a large amount of cream cheese on his face (the good kind).\n\nyeah. That was my day today (not to mention all the college apps I did).

First of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, \"No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard.\"  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.  \n\nI will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.  \n\nMy husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.

It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.  \n\nWe are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.  \nI'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.\n\nThank you.\n","135":"Her name is Chinadoll and she apparently had an enormous hairball stuck in her intestines.  We had taken her to the emergency vet clinic and they did a bunch of tests on her and all of them were really expensive, and then they told us that she would need surgery (which was $2000).  She is home and getting back to being her usual rambunctious self, but of course she should be lying down and recuperating.  We're all dead tired due to sleepless nights of waiting around at the clinic and worrying about her, of course, and could really go for some pizza.\n\nAs for the story behind Chinadoll, she is a huge, fluffy, grey cat.  She is sometimes very sweet and loving but usually cruel, stubborn, and dominating.  She is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  She has been described as a \"probability cloud of evil\".  As a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  My SO and I love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.\n\nIf you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like Cottage Inn.  Other pizza places would be fine, though.

Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.\n\nToday after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.   \n\nI had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined.

I'm on review, (meaning I have two days to get my average up, or I lose what is the best job I've ever had--I care so much about what I'm doing). Additionally, partly because it's been so cold here, my average has been down--which means, so is my pay.

I've been working all day for this non profit, (on my feet, outside), and I'm really hungry...I just ate my last two pieces of bread today. I'm applying for foodstamps tomorrow, but, obviously, that process takes a while. One pizza would give me two meals that I didn't have to wonder about.

The car I drive for my company is also breaking down, and a million other little things have gone wrong lately.\nI have never asked anything of reddit, and I feel awful for typing out this sob story. I promise that as soon as my tax refund comes through or I get a decent paycheck, (about two weeks?), I will either pay you back or pay it forward to another redditor, whichever you prefer. My roommates are also in a bind right now, but have done there best to help me out when they could, so I'd love to be able to offer them a few slices as a thanks, and to ensure that they both eat, too. Again, I'm sorry for bitching, I know I have it pretty good compared to most of the rest of the world, (a hint to the poverty-related nonprofit I work for), but I could really use some hot food and, even more so, a kind act. Whether you can help or not, thank you for reading.","159":"and ate all of mine and my girlfriends plates.

I requested a Pizza yesterday on account of being out of food. I did ask kind of late and did not get said pizza, my bad. I did not, however, go to bed hungry. It dawned on me that I had all the stuff for vegan fudge, I'm not vegan, or vegetarian, but I am pretty clever. Here's what I had for dinner. \n     3 cups sugar\n     1 1\/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)\n     2\/3 cups of coco\nWhat you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the \"hard ball\" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it. Super easy!\n     Anyway, I would like to eat real food tonight so if you can help out shoot me an email. Otherwise I'm eating fudge again. Could be worse...

But, at this point the new tab isn't quite so dire, sooo....\n\nI don't want to whine or drag on. Basically, I've been jobless for a few months now. My sister is my roommate; I'm basically crashing here, but have to be out next month, as she's apparently moving in with her boyfriend after that. No, I don't feel good about being a jobless layabout. I've been job hunting hard but nothing's been working out, and I can only really get around on foot.\n\nAnyway, so the only food I've had around here is potatoes. Which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) It's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland. The aforementioned sister spends most of her time with her boyfriend; my parents dropped off the bag of potatoes a couple of weeks ago. I don't wanna complain or anything, it's good to have a place to stay (for now) and sustenance,  but... a pizza, of any kind or any place, would be so so rad.

I was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. \nSo my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money\/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.\n\nAnyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter\/upvote you for life.\n\nI have these:\nHL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam","314":"No sad story, i'm just a really hungry (and broke) student working on an essay that's due tomorrow.

Tomorrow i plan to go sell some things to the pawn shop to get us through for a while. But we haven't eaten today. I know this is asking for a lot.

We do have junk food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies but no PIZZA. Dominoes will work if anyone is interested in helping me surprise my family.

My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. \n\nLuckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta.

Today, my wife and I lost our youngest cat Tula to liver failure (that is assumed, waiting on the official results).  We rescued her 2 years ago after a fox attack her in the wild.  The vet was going to put her asleep , but my wife, the lover of most living creatures convinced me to take her in.\n\nThis week she refused food and eventually last evening passed away.  My wife did get to see her Thursday, but she looked \"vacant\".  We both agreed we would donate her to the local university for them to perform the autopsy and possibly see what caused her liver to fail.\n\nI am asking for her for some pizza from the reddit community.  This is really for my wife because of the attachment that she had with her.  I can provide verification of Tula and the autopsy (when we get it).

First chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool.\"\n\nA friend responded with this link.\nNothing special about my story, but here goes.\nA bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie\/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.\n\nWhat can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. I live in the St. Johns neighbourhood of North Portland. Hope I got everything I need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise. Thanks reddit.","746":"My dead end job is killing me, I hate it, and I work way too hard at it.

If any kind redditor can assist, let me know...\n","916":"typical hungry college student stuck at home without money. I just got a job but I probably won't get paid until another week.

Hoping maybe one of you kind folks will send me some pizza to get me through the evening. \n\nthanks in advance if you do! \u2665","918":"I can't believe I never found Reddit before today, I've been wasting my life on 4chan -_- Things are a lot more awesome here.\n\nSo I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.\n\nI lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.\n\nHe's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.\n\nHe's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.\n\nAnyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?\n\nI don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.","919":"Hey there Reddit. Things haven't been going right for the next few days. My [roommate and best friend](http:\/\/imgur.com\/ALJUP) started having suicidal thoughts a few days ago, and ended up checking herself into the ER for observation. I've just paid off rent, two weeks late, and have no money until Thursday. And my younger sister came over today because she keeps getting sick at her apartment, which means there's two mouths to feed and not much food to go around.\n\nI'm lonely, sad, and worn down and I'm hoping that some pizza and silly tv shows might turn that around. Thing is, there's no pizza currently. If anyone is willing to donate some I would be insanely grateful. \n\nThanks in advance.","920":"My first time posting here so I thought I'd try it out. I've been broke from putting money into my gas tank for the 40 minute drive to school. On top of that my Financial Aid got delayed and my girlfriend (and we're no longer together) left for school this week. Broke and alone :( \n\nThanks for reading","921":"Ok, so I feel super weird doing this, but our week could really use a bright spot. I'm a single Dad of three of the greatest junior geeks you could ask for. After a week filled with bad news, we decided tonight we're all just going to huddle up together in the living room and watch Back to the Future and I would love to surprise them with pizza. \n\nI'm willing to offer up any verification you would like, and of course verify with a thank you post and PM to the mods.\n\nWe're not going to starve without the pizza, so if you see someone nerdier, please help them first. But if you can spare, it would bring some major smiles to my home. Thanks for reading this!\n\nEdit: Blerg...that should have said needier above, not nerdier. I'm not sure you will find nerdier people. :-)\n\n","922":"EDIT: Disregard, girl invited me to BBQ.  See you in a month, I'll still send out the pizzas.\n\nAll alone on fathers day sucks more than I thought it would.  I don't need much, just a small cheese from someone who cares to cheer me up.  I don't have enough $ for pizza and the gas I'll need to work my shitty job.  \n\nI've never done this before but if I get something I'll send out two pizzas next month in your honor.","923":"First things first, this is a sock puppet account.\n\nSecond things second, I do have a reputable **real** account and I will talk to you on that account if you private message me first on this one. I'm the creator\/mod of a top 50 most active subreddit (according to [subredditfinder](http:\/\/subredditfinder.com\/)). It's also in the top 100 in most subscribed, fastest rising, and other categories. The reason why I even mention this is so you know I'm a real redditor and not some random outsider trying to exploit your generosity. I'm not using my real account name for reasons I will thoroughly explain if you IM me. Even if you don't plan on helping me.\n\nFinally, what I **can** explain here in the open is this: I've lost 15lbs in ~1 week due to not eating. I've lost my appetite because of a major life crisis, but now as I'm trying to get back into the swing of things I need to be strong but severe loss of financial stability (i think the technical term is being broke as fuck) means that I'm starting to break down physically, and that will jeopardize my ability to get back on track with my life.\n\nI would actually prefer groceries (maybe milk, bread, or eggs), but I know thre is no Random_Acts_of_Balanced_Nutrition out there. I don't even know if I can get food stamps by now, and even if I can it might be too late. Either way, I would appreciate pizza just as much.\n\nAnyways, I realize that I am rambling, but I'd be more than glad to explain my full situation to anyone that cares. I just don't want to make this post searchable by a particular person for reasons I will explain.\n\nIf this sounds shady, I completely understand. But again, I will be more than glad to give full details in PM; info which can easily be verified.\n\nJust don't contact me with a sockpuppet account. I don't want some troll to go and fuck me over with the sensitive info I give them. We can talk 1-on-1 with our legit accounts.","924":"I would really appreciate a free pizza, I don't know if it works this specifically, but Pizza hut is the closest to my house.

Without me knowing about the loan my mother had taken out a few years ago, my family ended up losing our store.

Depression has kept me away from many things and this includes the day to day business and just knowing how far in the red we were.\n\nI have tried very hard to be a contributing member of society, but after 6 months of no work I am quickly losing hope. The one thing I have wanted for so long involves a tall glass of soda and a thick slice of pepperoni pizza.

Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game\/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.\n\n*Note: Contains disturbing and\/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*\n\n\nThe project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http:\/\/0011011001111000.bandcamp.com\/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/0011011001111000) and [here](http:\/\/0011011001111000.tumblr.com\/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.\n\n**So here's the thing:**\nI'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.

This all adds up to another 300+ dollars and I just had to pay rent which was another 450+ dollars.

I am a simple pepperoni type person, but I love trying new things.\n \nThis isn't a sob story of any kind, I just want a pizza. If you'd like, I am in the Orange County **~*area*.**\n\nI would love to pay this forward to someone some time. The idea of RAoP is awesome; giving the present of ooey-gooey-pizza goodness is amazing. \n\nI hope to get a Redditor who expands my tastes! \n\n*P.S. I never had anchovies. I love all meats. Cheese? Please! Lots.*","988":"","989":"Jobless, just paid rent (woohoo!), and need to pay few grand in taxes. It's been really tough to make ends meet these days. Which also means I've been eating rice and beans twice a day, every single day.\n\nLast night I dreamed about eating pizza, with its warm sauce and melty cheese. Today I get to eat...you guessed it...more rice! Yay! \n\nI try to stay upbeat about what's been going on, but sometimes it's just hard to keep smiling. Some real-life pizza would make this gloomy NYC afternoon much brighter. It really would make all the difference to me.\n\nAnd of course, I'd love to pay it forward when my situation improves.","990":"I work as a sub-contractor and my boss decided to leave town when he owed me money for this week's work. I had been counting on that money because my kids are here until Tuesdy night. My 7 yo daughter even mentioned how I never have anything good to eat here (it was completely innocent, but still hits home). Glad to buy someone a pizza Tuesday night... In need right now though. Anyone? ","991":"Hey, my girlfriend has celiac disease and hasn't had a pizza in a long time. But today we found out that Domino's has gluten free pizza. I was wondering if anyone would be nice enough to order me one for her.\n\nThanks!","992":"**First let me say that I will provide any reasonable verification as to the validity of what I am going to say. Just message me. I am very sorry for the pity parade, honestly, however my embarrassment is over weighed by my concerned for my friend and her family. If you have any advice that I can forward to her please private message me. Thank you.**\n\nSo here is the situation:\nI am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). \n\n**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**\n\nThe problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't). ","993":"Have 10 bucks need it for gas. \nWife, 2 1\/2 year old daughter, and I would love some pie. Ill pizza someone else Thursday when I get paid. Thanks!","994":"I don't really have a sob story. My little brother is coming up to my apartment for a few days, and I don't have the money to get a lot of food for us to have an all out bash, so it would be nice to have a little slice!","995":"","996":"So this is my roommate and my last night living together, we will both be going home which is about 3-4 hours apart. We've been friends since middle school and probably wont be able to hang out anymore (at least for a long time). We both recently left our jobs (I helped him get one on campus where I work). I worked their for 2 years and he worked there for a year. It would be nice to commemorate our final night of living together.","997":"I will go ahead and say that I got a pizza meal from here before as to not seem like I'm scamming anyone. I have been promised 2 well-paying jobs and one minimum wage + .40 to fill in the gaps of unemployment of a second job, if that makes sense, but I'm waiting until they call me in for that expendable job, a background check for one, and a test request for the other. I will be able to pay forward this one and the previous random act of pizza when I can get my life straight. I will pay the previous one forward whether I get food from this or not. Didn't want to sound like I'm taking that promise to pay it forward hostage. Anyway, it would benefit me, my roommate, his brother, and his mom greatly if we could get some pizza.\n\nEdit: Not caring what trolls like francewinwars say, especially if all they do is convince people to NOT help the less-fortunate. If anyone wants to roll the dice and buy us pizza for the day, I will pay it forward as soon as I get spare cash, which should be within the next couple of months.","998":"If someone would like to buy me a pizza I will gladly return the favor friday when I get paid! I just ran out of food and don't want to wait till friday to eat. Thanks for considering!","999":"Yesterday I got laid off with a job I've been working for over a year now. My boyfriend hasn't been working for the past two months since he also got laid off working construction. I have no idea what we are going to do now..rent is due on the 5th at the latest and the next check I get wont be until the 12th. Pretty much feeling shitty about everything right now, trying to figure out what I can do to get money quickly. Plus my ph. is gonna be outta mins, my insurance, and internet bill is due...oh ya &gt;.&lt; ...could really use a random act of pizza. ","1000":"Hey guys, don't have much to say. College student, aspiring comedian. Don't have a lot of money flowing at the moment but today is Monday Madness in Athens (3.99 medium 1-topping) and I could really use some food for the week. Anyone out there wanna help a brother out, just throwing it out there. Will be checking this throughout the day. Promise I will do the same once I get paid for a show (which is rare but I am hoping someone trusts me). That is all. ","1001":"If anyone is interested in my story here it is.\nI was kicked out of my parent's home a few months ago for religious reasons and I'm struggling to make ends meet living on my own. My mormon parents don't talk to me and don't want to have anything to do with me after they found out I'm not going on my mission. I have a job and a room but my hours were weekends only last month and I'm completely broke until the end of this week when I get paid and even then, money is going to be tight for the next few months. I was not really prepared to live on my own like this (I just recently turned 20) and I'm really struggling. I'm trying to eat as little as I can to save as much money as I can and pizza would be amazing right now.\n(I'm in Toronto, Ontario)","1002":"I just moved into a new house this week. And need alittle help until I get paid. My bank accounts drained. And I'm so hungry. And so tired of ramen. ","1003":"My friend I think deserves a RAOP. No need to say exact reasons, but this would certainly make him feel a whole lot better. Thanks everyone. ","1004":"I'm currently sitting at a McDonalds, where I slept in my truck last night, with no gas and no money for food. I didn't get anything to eat yesterday, and so far today it's looking like it's gonna be the same way. There is a Pizza Hut within walking distance, and would really appreciate any kind of food. It really sucks to have to ask for something like this, but it's either this or go outside and beg for money face to face.","1005":"Anyone feel like donating a pizza to a hungry college student? I'd be very happy to eat today. ","1006":"I got pizza'd, thanks Lexically. ","1007":"I (Rachel) and my friends (Liz and Dylan) do not get paid for multiple days and are pretty much subsisting off of PB&amp;J, noodles with butter, and the last little bit of a bottle of tequila. It is nice tequila though. My point is, we are hungry and broke until further notice and we would love nothing more than a pizza at this very moment. Help a sister out and we'll hit you back, pay it forward, either or both. Much obliged   :)","1008":"My Girlfriend and I are down on our luck and getting desperate. I lost my job at the start of the summer and we've been floating by just barely managing to keep the rent covered. We've both been looking for jobs very actively, just haven't had any luck at all. We've got a bit of cash on the way next week, but no money until then. Not complaining about all that, but we haven't eaten in nearly three days and we're getting damn hungry. I'm more than happy to repay this favor in the future if someone would help us out tonight. ","1009":"We're a family of 6 and we're completely broke. Money wise and food wise.

I'm 6 months pregnant, and we need help. Our family is large and we're running out of food. We won't receive our food stamps for another week, and no one has any money to even attempt to buy food. We're hot, hungry, and would be extremely grateful if we could receive anything.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm willing to prove my situation via photos with date stamps in a PM.","1012":"Now I know just straight up asking for a pizza isn't really inventive or innovative, but I'm kinda just without any money at all and could go for one or two, saving the slices for a meal every so often.\nI think you can probably buy a pizza online from the Pizza Hut or Dominos NZ branch near me from anywhere in the world, but if you're in NZ that's even cooler.\nAnyway, yeah. Thanks in advance. I can give you my Steam name and we can have a few games to celebrate if you want, or I could give a little thanks on my Youtube channel if that's what you'd like. I can't really offer much other than that, but yeah, enough rambling.\nI guess PM me if you're willing? :D","1013":"My boyfriend was supposed to get paid Thursday, but at the first of this month we moved and spent all of his last check on moving costs and first months rent. We also bought some groceries, but only bought enough to last until this paycheck. It still hasn't come and we've run out of food. Could we have a pizza? We only need one, and will gladly forward! \n\nBtw, I'm his girlfriend, I don't have a job because I'm in school full-time. I have student aid, but didn't get any for my summer courses, so only have a limited amount. I used most of my funds to pay his student loans so we wouldn't get any fees, or I would be buying cook-able food! Thank you guys soo much! (just saying...because, this is awesome).\n","1014":"I'm about to leave my newlywed wife for 3 weeks to go train in the desert and would love to share a pizza and watch a movie with her the night before I have to leave!","1015":"\nI work in a restaurant and my manager is firing people and cutting hours.

The bf and I have irons in the fire, but we're stressing out and worried about how we're going to get by. A hot pizza and a reminder that acts of kindness are still occasionally possible in this world would go a long way toward cheering up our little family.  I'm in the Louisville KY area. Thanks reddit!","1016":"Found out I still owed the government money now I only have $2.  Just want a pizza to last me for a few days.","1017":"So, I am a web developer who was laid off a bit ago.

I am a 65 year old disabled veteran. I suffer from agent orange among many other things. I am coming to you today to request a random act of pizzas to fill my belly.

I was referred to this site by my grand daughter.","1020":"I posted yesterday but a very nice lady from work knew I was having some financial trouble and got us food for last night. So I deleted my request. Today we are back in the same boat. Like I stated yesterday, this is out of my comfort zone because I am usually the one trying to help somebody. My husband was laid off about 3 months ago and we usually are able to make it from check to check. I also take care of my Grandmother how is disabled. But this week has been rough. My car broke down on Tuesday. Had to get a new battery and a couple of other small parts to get it back running. This set us back. We are now Broke.

Long time lurker, occasional commenter, first time poster.\n\nIn any case finals are looming in on me and, while I certainly have a chance to kick their ass and earn myself a 3.0 GPA this semester, I am still nervous. It is for this reason why I am requesting a pizza-- to have a little motivation and something delicious to eat while studying.\n\nI will have money come in at the end of the month, so when that time comes I should be able to pay it forward. Thanks so much for your consideration. :)\n","1023":"My parents and I are on a gluten free diet (no flour\/wheat - no pizza crust) and scraping toppings off just ain't my thing.

I live in central FL. My husband and I have 3 young children. My husband is a local truck driver and I am a stay-at-home mom. A couple months ago our roof decided to start leaking, right in to our bedroom. Insurance isn't covering it because the roof is old. We are trying to save to repair the roof and replace the drywall that was damaged. Since that time, things have continued to spiral downward. I don't want to be long winded, but it has gone so far that we have had to apply for foodstamps and medicaid because I have 2 have surgery and a diagnostic procedure to rule out cervical cancer. My husband's wages have been cut because the runs just aren't there. We are struggling and the only way that we have had any food for the past couple of weeks is because of my parents. I have been looking for a job, but I have had no success. We are even having to sell our electronics on craigslist to try and get some money to survive. It has been very stressful and frustrating for us and I know our kids can tell that something is wrong. I was hoping that someone might be willing to give us just one bright spot in this dark time.

I used to help run Burlington Emergency Shelter in Burlington, VT. It is a shelter to help provide housing for up to 22 homeless men and women. They only run on donations. No Federal or State funding is used. They rely on donations to provide a meal each night for their guests. Their guests are ordinary people that either lost their jobs or just couldn't work anymore. I personally know what it is like to be homeless as I had went to the shelter in need myself.

I am from Texas, and for the past few months I've been preparing to start college in Florida. The original plan was I would drive here to Florida, take a test, then return home and do my coursework online for the first 90 days, which would give me time to pull the funds together for the move to Florida. Unfortunately, they failed to inform me that the online option only applies to students who do exceptionally well on that test, which I did not. Just for the first trip, I had to sell something that was very important to me. Then I took the test and they told me I either had to give up my dream of becoming a student at their university, or move to Florida immediately. I returned to Texas and did everything I could think of to raise money for the early move, and in a final act of desperation, I sold even more of my belongings. Now I am in Florida, with 2 boxes of clothes, sleeping on a fellow classmate's (who also has no money) couch, with $2.00 in my wallet, wondering what I will do for food for the next 30 days, which is when my Veteran's Benefits kick in and I will finally be able to afford to eat.

Me and my roommate are bio majors (senior year) and we are currently taking microbiology. FUCKING. HELL. I don't want to go on too much of a rant here, but essentially, our professor is not a very nice person. When hurricane Sandy came rolling through, given that we had missed at least a week and a half of school, most professors took this into consideration and removed certain assignments that were due considering time constraints. NOT THIS BITCH. In fact, she added onto the syllabus. In the end, we had a little more than 400 pts due in the last week of class in an 800pt course. I have never been so stressed in my entire college career and I think my roommate is about to lose it. \n\nOur freezer is empty. We run to the caf when we can (considering its not closed because our school sucks sometimes), but it has been the same food since the beginning of the semester, and quite frankly, makes me piss out of my asshole.

I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect.

It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.\n\nIn any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately.

Now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. Now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza. \n\n\nBut with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st.

Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself. Tomorrow.\n\n\ni head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, Phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. Oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza.

Long-time lurker, first time poster on reddit!\n\nSo at the ripe age of 22, I have finally moved out of my mom's house, and into an apartment with a friend of mine.

Unfortunately, all our money has been spent on the aforementioned things, and we're down to rice and ramen in the cupboards until my first paycheck. (She's still trying to find a job).

It's Saturday, I have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now. \n\nBy trade, I am a freelance writer. Sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. But I understand the give-and-take of economy and I'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. So I'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. Haiku about Thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, I can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as I can fit on the page. And none of that copy-paste bull crap either, I promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.\n\nMaybe you want more than one page. These things happen. And I happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. Or I might want mushrooms AND pepperoni. We can work it out.\n\nJust about the only thing I won't write is a signed confession that I was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. Let them figure it out on their own.\n\nIf you order a pizza for me, I promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming I have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15). Can provide photo proof of brown sky, flat tire on bike, or other reasonable requests if needed. Will gladly provide gratuitous photo proof of pizza enjoyment if desired.\n\nThanks RAoP!","1396":"I was evicted from my home this past monday.. I spent all last week desperately searching for a place to live..  Since I'm disabled, and still waiting for my benefits to start, I knew I could never afford a place for myself.. So I did what most people in my situation would do.. I had faith that between my family and all my friends..  SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought.. Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. Since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, I had to move on to my good friends.. My best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn't an option.. My other best friend AND neighbor would definitely take me in.. I just knew she would!!  She has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. So I asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. Without even pretending to think about it.. She said \"I don't have any room for you\".. That was it.. I had exhausted all my options.. One day before my eviction I started to plan the best way to be homeless.. I decided to live in my van.... Scary doesn't come close to how I felt, but my fear was deep.... Ring Ring! It's Curtis.. A friend I met thru my best friend.. I knew him and considered him a friend but we didn't know each other very well.. Without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  I burst into tears.. I was relieved.. But mostly, I was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as I am!  So here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. Trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat TONIGHT.. Let alone tomorrow.. But It's 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. I want Curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!

My gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and \"one thing just lead to another\" and they had fallen inlove. This had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when I got custody of him. Yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. I tried to go about my day the way I would any other day, I went to my AA meeting got my 24 months sober token. I went to work and got through the day as best I could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. After work I went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. I didn't know what else to do. I wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. I don't know how I am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live. My bills are adding up quickly and we have no food. My landlord is very strict and will not bend on my rent because we've only lived here for 90 day. I am but sure what to do. School starts next week and I can't get supplies or outfits. I used my last bit of gas to go to a food pantry only to find out that I make too much money for assistance and I can't get a payday loan because I got one two weeks ago to help fix my now exs car. I hope someone here can help me or direct me somewhere I can get help. Thank you for reading.

I feel like I should be honest about this being another request after a somewhat recent one from us. But we are stuck in such a bad situation this month, we called food banks to see if any of them could drop off some food for us (but none will deliver, even if you have no transportation, which we don't) and with $1.51 to our name right now, this is all I could think of. \n\nThank you for reading and considering our request.

The dumpster is full of lost dreams of dinner, that sadly spoiled.  Anyways... I introduced this girl to Reddit tonight, and we happen to be hungry.

These last two weeks have sucked, and I would really appreciate not worrying about one thing--namely, food--after all the torrential bad events I've experienced. In short:\n\n* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. \n\n* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia\n\n* Got rejected.\n\n* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.\n\n* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems\n\n* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).\n\n* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. \n\n* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.\n\n* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.\n\n* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. \n\nAside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger. \n","1836":"I'm a 22 year old guy living in the outskirts of Seattle.

He has had several blood tests and labs done and we're hopefully getting the results back tomorrow. He has been tested from everything from food allergies and parasites to some pretty serious diseases. As of yesterday he has been feeling a bit better and is feeling up to eating something other than soup. I told him a while ago that once he was feeling better he could have whatever he wanted.

I am deeply touched reading all of these posts.  Both from those in need, and those looking to help.  It is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  There was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  We've learned to live on what we have, and I'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.  I make sure they're fed, but I can never give them anything above and beyond that.  It would just be really amazing to be able to surprise them with a pizza some night.  Believe me, I know how fortunate I am to have a roof over our heads, and a car that works right most of the time.  And there are people I'm sure who need so much more than we do.  And as soon as I'm in a position to help them, I guarantee I'm going to be on here doing that.  God bless all of you.","1862":"I'm a BU student and can hardly afford groceries, let alone pizza.

This last week has been the worst as I contracted the usual bout of seasonal illness. Recently I had to fill in applications to stay in their dorms for this summer, and also this fall. This has come with the unfortunate circumstances of rules, vague descriptions, loopholes, and lots of spending. Turns out that if I only sent in one application for \/both\/ summer\/fall at the time the summer applications were due, I would only have had to pay 40 dollars instead of 80. Loopholes!

","1865":"I won't pretend I would go hungry without this delicious doughy cheesy love, but I do have a story.  I just emptied the little money I had left in my bank account to register for classes at my local community college.  I never finished my degree and left and worked at a big company making good money for a while.  When that came to an end I moved and had no clue what to do.  I have been looking for work for over 2 years now.  I just recently had to move back home, and I am incredibly lucky to have a mother who would even allow such a thing.  She still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  Hopefully I can be a positive influence to everyone now that I am living with my fam.  I know my little bro is going to love the three drumsets I brought home (he just started learning).  He seems genuinely interested in music, and I know that's one thing I can really help him with.  Even though I didn't work over the past few years, I have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  I am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  My goal is to get back into a University in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in Europe for a while (I love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).  I kinda did everything backwards, but I am actually excited about working towards my goals.  I would love to celebrate this new beginning with some pizza, but the few bucks I have to spend for myself are going towards bills and I want to take my little bro to go see the Hobbit tomorrow when he gets off of school.  Like I said, I wouldn't go hungry, but pizza seems like a good way to celebrate the first step in changing my path.\n\nWe all must face the consequences of our actions, and I want my actions to finally start having beneficial consequences.

They're supposed to refund our unused rent and give us a little extra, but there's no telling when we'll see that check. We've spent every dime we have moving into a new place; deposit, first and last month's rent, getting utilities turned on, etc. really adds up. We're looking at an empty pantry and totally bummed.

She is coming out to visit me this weekend (gets here Friday night) and I'd love to have a nice pizza waiting for her after the 5 1\/2 hour drive she has to make. Unfortunately, in order for her to visit she has to stay in a hotel and we're splitting the cost (considering she paid for gas), meaning I do not have the extra money to buy a pizza. Hook a brother up?\n\nEDIT: As a reward, I will send the generous donor a mash-up of Gangnam Style, Party Rock Anthem, Like a G6, Pretty Fly (For a White Guy), and Bad Touch that is no longer available for public download, but very well mixed and great to listen to.","1916":"and my first week off since January (aside from spring break).

I could really use a good pizza right now as all my money has gone to putting a down payment on a house and tuition for next semester. Life's a garden, dig it.  ","1918":"So I'm one of those people brought here by the recent media coverage.  I'm sorry if that makes me an outsider.  I've spent the last few days just reading through this site.  Both the pizza end of things and other areas.  I had no idea about reddit.  This Random Acts of Pizza is truly amazing to follow.  You laugh at the guy who's just bored and wants someone to send him a pizza, and you feel for the people that a pizza would be more than a pizza.  I've been hesitant to post because while I'm in a tough spot, it lacks in comparison to so many others.  I finally decided I'd just give it a try.  Worse case scenario, I don't get a pizza.  That's where I am anyway :)\n\nI've been married for almost 10 years.  My wife and I have two beautiful children, a daughter 5, and a son 6.  When I met my wife, I was working crazy hours and didn't always have time for everything we wanted, but Friday night was always our date night.  It started purely by accident when she invited me over for pizza and a movie one night, and we've kept the tradition alive all these years.  We used to go out to the movies, and when that got too expensive, we enjoyed a movie at home.  When the kids got older, date night was expanded to family night.  Pizza and a movie for everyone.  We've gone through a lot of things in the last few years.  It's often felt like one step forward and two steps back.  We're still moving though.  Still fighting.  There came a point where pizza became a luxury, and it's something we've accepted and moved on.  I laugh when people talk about discretionary income.  We've learned to shave a lot of corners and given up a lot of things just to pay the bills.  \n\nAnyway, I guess my request is this.  I would love to, just for one night, be able to surprise the family with our pizza tradition.  They deserve it, and I wish I could give it to them.\n\nI'm sure above me and below me are probably posts of people that need it more than we do, and I say give it to them.  If someone knows what it's like to be in this place and wants to help out, it would be much appreciated.\n\nI look forward to the day I can come on here and make someone's day.  No promises of when I'll be able to do that, but I can promise it will happen, and I will be spreading the word about this and hope that more people will offer help to those who need it.\n\nThanks for listening, and sorry for the long post.  ","1919":"Just moved to Conshohocken apartments in Philly. I have had ramen for the last 4 days and I wont have money for stuff for a few weeks.

My expenses will be halved, and I'll be closer to everything that's hapening :D \n\nI keep feeling this mix of anticipatory excitement and nauseating terror - it's clear that this is kind of a moment, like I'm closing a chapter on one part of my life and starting the next one. And I wanna celebrate with pizza, not with ramen or easy mac, which is all I'll have til payday on Friday.\n\nSo really, I just want a greasy carb bomb to the gut, to properly honor this moment!

I have a beautiful wife and a really awesome son who I love very much. I know begging is the last thing people want to do but I am at that level. I don't know what to do and I have barely enough money to cover all of this. I would really appreciate it if someone would gift us a pizza and I'm sure so would my family.

Many nights we go without dinner(sometimes i survive on cups of coffee all day) but we never lose sight that things will get better for us eventually. We are in the middle class rut; don't make enough to survive comfortably in California but are making too much money for food assistance. It leaved us caught in a limbo. Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone. \n\nIt seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me.

I took my dog [Volk](http:\/\/tinypic.com\/r\/241rqmf\/7), he was 25% Timber Wolf 75% German Sheperd, to the vet yesterday because he stopped eating and was generally acting really weird, not wanting to move. It had been getting worse over the course of last week. After the vet's initial examination, he thought it had something to do with Volks kidneys, so I left him with the vet overnight. I got a call this morning from the Vet's office, telling me that it was some congenital disease, that causes terminal kidney failure and that though I could probably keep him alive on dialysis for a while, it would be extremely expensive and he wouldn't be living a full, happy life. So, I went in this morning and said good-bye. \nAnyway, the total cost of the visit, tests, and euthanasia was close to $300, all of which I had to pay up front.

(North County)~~\n\n~~We have a three bedroom house that the bank is trying to foreclose on.

My mom's transmission also failed around last month so we've been taking the bus.~~\n\n~~We have been able to manage lately, until recently when my sister and her husband declared they would not be paying my mom rent for staying here anymore, and I found out they had only been paying my mom seventy-five dollars each for the past four months. It has been a pretty big blow, albiet not surprising, and has now put an even greater strain on my mom and I.~~\n\n~~As of yesterday SDGE came through and shut off our electricity. (I am writing via phone.) The bill is just over six-hundred dollars past due (I just found out) and my mom has been calling around trying to find help. I know it is probably stupid to request a pizza in lieu of everything else but I thought it would be a nice change from everything else going on right now.~~\n\n~~I know sob stories are probably cliche here, and my apologies for that.

I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (\u00a39 to last until the end of August).\n\nI went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).\n\nFor years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.\n\nThis, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates \u00a3100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a \u00a3970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only \u00a330 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and \u00a340 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her \u00a3500).\n\nI've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.\n\nI spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.\n\nSorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...\n\nBut yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. Thanks for listening &lt;3","2010":"First time playing Tijuana, Mexico earlier this week and I was a little sketched out.

We've come down to stay for a few days, and none of us have cars, so we're essentially stuck food free.\n\nNow, here's the tricky part. The two people we are staying with are currently having 'a relationship tiff'. Essentially they've left us downstairs, post several joints, and we have absolutely no food, and a tremendous, burning desire for it.\n\nWe're sat desperately hoping they aren't breaking up, as this would be seriously uncool whilst high, and it would firmly delay our chance to eat pizza.\n\nThank you.","2037":"I've been going to school at the art institute of wisconsin for about a year now, and since I don't actually live in Milwaukee and I'm kinda awkward, its a little hard to make friends. what better way than to offer them some free pizza and have a nice chat? would be much appreciated.","2038":"I'd love to get a pizza for my dad, it'd have been my moms birthday tomorrow and hes taking it pretty rough..\nhe's visiting me tonight and I can't afford to get one myself right now, buy will pay it forwards asap, promise !\n(toronto, ontario, canada)","2039":"My roommates, some who are graduating, and I are trying to celebrate this last week but are broke like normal college students.

I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this, I've lost a lot of weight over the past few months and things just keep getting worse.

I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.\n\nAnyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.\n\nBasically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen\/bathroom\/toilet\/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep. \nThat happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play\/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed. Spoke with the family I _just_ came from about this and I'm invited back over for dinner on Friday, the day prior to my payday. Still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. I already said that. Um.\n\nI've no idea of etiquette here, I've no idea if I said too little or not enough, but hey there's my request.

He begins grilling me about some sensitive information I had leaked and wants to know how I found out. I have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.\n\nWhat was the information? Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.\n\nHow did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.\n\nNothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.\n\nI somehow took the news alright. I mean, I was definitely plotting my revenge on \"the man\" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.\n\nI drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. Which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and I found myself underneath a 2006 Dodge Charger. \n\nThe driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.\n\nSo now we're at the present moment.

It makes me cringe thinking about it actually. \n\nAnyway, we're trying to watch the new Game of Thrones tonight and we both agree a pizza is in order. \n\nHope you can help us out!\n\nEDIT: I don't know if any of you have seen this video, but it pretty much sums up our desires. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wusGIl3v044\n\n\n","2109":"if you can i will really appreciate it. i have looked and saw that only Pizza Hut has a way to buy pizza with online payment. if you can buy me a Vegetarian Pizza i will be happy. \n\nThanks.","2110":"the aroma fills the air\n\nas i wait patiently to eat\n\npepperoni, cheese, and sausage\n\nall are such a delicious treat\n\n","2111":"EDIT: I have been offered pizza for my family, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\n\nI'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.\n\nMy husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the \"world\" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.\n\nI applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.\n\nAnyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.\n\nWe are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing\/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet\/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.\n\nI'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.\n\nI want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of proof I could give? His checks are direct deposited with no stubs mailed yet. Let me know what I need, I can try to figure out something to prove if requred.","2112":"Tomorrow I have a pretty stressful day ahead of me. I've got to do tons of calling and mailing and application filling out to do in order to drop one school and enroll in another.

Normally ramen is fine, but whenever I eat them only I only seem to have a bare minimum of energy, and I have a test tomorrow... I really can't fail this class.\n\nI've ordered pizzas for people and bought people games on Steam before, but no one's ever given me hand.\n\nGot a job interview soon, and every time I get an interview I get the job, so money flow will happen soon and I will pay you back.\n","2116":"It would be much appreciated.","2117":"We have a 1\/4 of a box of rice to our names and are done our exams tomorrow night!

I also put in a lot of energy (made gifts, gave encouragement, helped calm down anxiety attacks...)\n\nThe good news is, if they're that quick to turn on me based on someone's false information, I don't want them in my life anyway.

I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is \"always hiring\" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food. I've been surviving off the kindness of my landlord\/roommates, (I do dishes I don't have to pay for food) but that can only go so far.

Let's say, Dave Mustaine. Dave and I started talking over a social media site, but for vagueness, we'll say headnovel. We met in real life shortly after, and became the best of friends very fast. About 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and I got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. To rectify this, Dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. Things went from best friends to Relationship pretty fast. But Dave had a boyfriend she never saw. Literally, NEVER. He asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. Eventually, I told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. So I cut it off. Fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. I wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. She frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. This time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. I didn't regret it at first. I do now. Dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. But for some dumb reason, I still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. I wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that I thought was the girl of my dreams. I still want to fix it. But she just hurts me. All day, I've tried to act normal, like hang out with friends and such, and I just feel removed from it.

If anyone is willing to make my day by sending me pizza. I would be more then grateful for the random act of kindness.  I have a RAOP verification code if needed. ","2275":"New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.\n\n I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.\n\nI've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.\n\nMy family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?\n\nSince I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.\n\nSo that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. Tomorrow and Thursday I'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since April I'll get offered a job. If nothing else wish me luck on that. Also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse I've been afflicted with I'm selling it on the cheap =)","2276":"Hey I would so grateful for a pizza right now.

I rode my water bill too long this time around. Now just a few days before I could pay them it's been shut off, and they've made it clear they won't cut it back on without payment first. I live mostly off instant noodles and macaroni, now I can't even boil water for a cup of tea. Right now my sink is loaded with dirty dishes that'll probably be ruined by the time I can run the dishwasher. I don't get anymore cash until this weekend, so the water isn't coming back anytime soon. I'm not working at the moment and I don't have wheels anymore either. My bank account is literally drawn down to the 70 cent mark, even if I had transport I couldn't buy anything substantial. \n\nWhen I asked a neighbor I get along with just to let me fill up a milk jug he told me no instantly. He acted like I was asking him at gun point. So he can borrow my edger, but me asking for a gallon of water is the line, apparently. I don't know what I'm going to do when I inevitably need to flush the toilet. I got a lot of time to come up with creative solutions but food isn't something I can come up with a fix for. I was going to live off spaghetti and macaroni until payday but now I'm stuck with no water to boil them in. I ate an uncooked ramen brick for a meal earlier, if I don't get some real food I think I'll go nuts. I can provide proof if someone needs it, I'll scan the note the left for me or whatever you guys wants. I'm being real here, I'm in a bad way and the end isn't in sight quite yet.

I got all my verification turned in, but it is taking them so long to process it. I am hoping we get it before Thanksgiving, since their office will be closed from Thursday-Monday. I don't know what I'll do if they fail to complete processing my application before their Thanksgiving break.

My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.\n\nIt would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome Thursday night we had planned.

I'm **not** starving, trying to feed 10 people, telling a made up sob story, or crying over having ugly walls. Still with me? Ok. Lets have some fun with this!\n\nI have linked some pictures below, so that you see what you have to work with. The walls are an off white\/egg color (bleh). Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought \"Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?\" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D\n\nI hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. \n\nAnyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white\/egg shell. Please and thank you :)\n\n[Pics of my room](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/qRQa7).\n\n*","2396":"My unemployment benefits have been exhausted and my interview for food stamps isn't until Tuesday.

I've given before and never received.\n\nFirst up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. \n\nI'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)\n\nAdd that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for\/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P\nWe literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. \n\nWhat would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. \n\nI might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P\n\nBut thanks for reading anyway, RAoP!\n\nAlso, please and thank you ;)","2399":"Ok, first of all, I just made this account, A really good friend of mine suggested that I might be able to find some help out today.  i'm 4 hours away from my wife and daughter, because of my job.

She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her \"diet\", and baby food.\n\nWhat I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!\n\nThanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.\n\nTL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to.

Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \"dick\"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break\/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com\/](www.lctabus.com\/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend\/his mommy: ([Ana](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.\n\n.\n\nPS: When we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward.

I just want to go into a small amount of detail in this post and tell you guys how much we're in love. I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.\n\n\nI was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of \"Alright, if you really want to,\" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement \"ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--\"\n\n\nSo we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.\n\n\nSo she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word \"Tony\" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.\nSo I read just the 1 text. It states:\n\"Tony better remember what you asked for last week.\"\nMy stomach got this twisted feeling of \"oh crap how could I forget.\" \n\n\n!!!!! \n\n\nJUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream \"hey wait!\". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)\n\n\nI took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.\n\n\nShe has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said \"I thought you forgot!\".\n\n\nShe took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. \"I will love you until the last pepperoni fades.\" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.\n\n---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.\n\n\nI would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love.","2593":"I got a job at Dominos recently but they are having trouble getting me through the system and it is taking forever to actually start my training.

The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.  \n\n[Following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy Polish mothers]\n\nNow you may be wondering \"What's wrong with the last part\" in which I will refer you to the crutches.  Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.\n\nAnyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say \"I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.\"  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.\n\nAlso, since I'm getting my first paycheck in June 30th, I'll make sure to donate a pizza.  \n","2745":"I'm not starving or anything, so if someone else posts with a much more dire situation than me, I'd encourage you to send pizza to them.

We are hungry because are foster home doesnt get a food delivery untill monday and all we have to eat is shitty dry cereal and old freezer burned meat. I would love to have a pizza or two. I live in a foster home with 5 other boys. I live in SOS childrens village in coconut creek florida. If you need the adress let me know.","3005":"I was talking to this girl for almost a month that I truly liked. Finally asked her out in a date tried yo call her the next day and she hit me with \"your a great Guy but i can't date you\". Please I need comfort food\n","3006":"My friend thinks that RAoP is a farce, and either an attempt to gather addresses or send pranks. I just want to show him he's wrong. A large extra cheese\/extra sauce pizza might change his tune. Afterwards, I might be able to convince him to pitch in to fulfill someone else's request...\n\nI'm located in the Antelope Valley in California. I intend to provide pictures of said delicious pizza if it arrives.","3007":"My 20th birthday was the 14th (Of may) and I was Kicked out of my place (I had just been laid off). Since then I have moved in with a family member, but we are out of food (He is on food stamps, I am in the process of getting them and getting unemployment while I find a new job). Today his car broke down so we are having trouble trying to hit up the local food pantry, we have some food in the house but I would love to surprise him with a pizza pie for dinner tonight.\n\nWilling to provide any proof needed. Will be able to return the favor at the end of June (Should have my unemployment by then)","3008":"Hi guys-- I'm a college student in Atlanta, Georgia. I just finished my finals and today is my boyfriend's last day at his awesome Co-Op. I'd love to be able to make today a celebration! Regrettably, like more students, I'm flat broke. Anyone willing to help my boyfriend and I celebrate? As soon as my loan money comes in in January I'd love to return the favor :)","3009":"We dont tend to have fast food pizza, we make all our own food at home, but we do enjoy a good hot pizza every now and then. We are incredibly unlikely to buy OURSELVES a pizza, as we tend to use our food money at the Farmer's Market, but if someone were to buy us a pizza today, I would definitely return the favor, or pay it forward, whichever the sender prefers. We are located in North Florida and we are not at all picky as to which chain the pizza comes from :)","3010":"We ate lunch yesterday around noon, then proceeded to get crazy hammered and have zero food (literally. I checked) in the house. We're also out of money on account of paying for gas to drive some girls home this morning. Fact is, we're starving. I remembered hearing about this place awhile back and thinking, \"DisplacedLeprechaun, one day you'll be hungry as hell. Try that subreddit and see if it can help.\"\n\nSo here I am. And if it works, come this Friday on my payday I'll be giving a pizza to someone on here. Fair is fair.\n\nCheers!","3011":"I've been having such a down week worrying about my sick mother, being overloaded at work, how we'll be paying rent and upcoming bills, let alone food, for the next week...I would absolutely love some warm food to help tidy my growling stomach and my mind in the meantime.  Our pantry is bare and I have little $ to my name at the moment.\n\nI'm located in California by the way  \n\nI can PM you from my main account, I was just paranoid\/ashamed because a simple google search provided much detailed information about me; I use that username all over the web..\n\nThank you, reddit~","3012":"So, a friend got screwed out of a place tonight (landord dick-ness), and as such is stuck using what little money she has left paying for a hotel in Southwest Florida. If you kind pizza-ers can give her a hand that'd be swell. I know it's not me, but she's never used Reddit, and College has also left me quite poor. You have my word that I will pay it forward. Thanks regardless!","3013":"I just arrived back at school after visting my family in Wisconsin over the holidays. Unfortunately while I was there I ran in to some pretty serious car problems and a hefty bill. Paying for my car so I could make it back to school cost everything in my bank account (and a couple hundred dollars my parents were able to help me with ): ). Now I'm at my appartment with nothing to eat and could really use a pie to tide me over untill class starts monday and I get my financial aide. Thanks ","3014":"As the title says, it's been a rough month for my family for a number of reasons financial troubles being on the top of the list. My reason for posting is that groceries have been pretty sparce for the past week or so. The kids, wife and I have been had our fill of bland pastas and such. Payday is in less than a week and the generosity of friends and family in addition to picking up odd jobs here and there are the only things that have gotten us through this month.\n\nLong story short, a pizza sounds unbelievably awesome right about now, even more so when imagine the how excited the kids would be after a week of serving dinner to sad face and disappointed grumbles.","3015":"Just got done paying this months bill, rent, and utilities. Won't have any cash coming in for a little more than a week. A pizza would definitely keep me alive for a good part of that.

My first day was today! I picked my son up a little while ago and have no energy left to cook and I am really hungry. If someone would send a pizza it would mean the world to me and my son. ","3021":"I'm home from college for the summer and my parents are gone for the weekend. Unfortunately, my LCD screen failed on my toshiba laptop and after shipping it to them, they've told me that I owe them $200 for fixing the POWER JACK before they'll fix my screen despite the fact that it's under warranty and that I didn't send it in for them to fix anything but the screen. After arguing with them over a span of two days and looking at other options, I gave in and am now broke. I've eaten ramen for virtually every meal for the past 2 and a half days and I can't do it anymore. It would be sweet if a fellow redditor could help a guy out.","3022":"Now all I want is Pizza Hut. :)","3023":"I am feeling depressed. I do not know if it is the study of law and the tedious reading that goes with it or the hunger in my belly causing it. If some kind soul wishes to help me eliminate the hunger in my belly, we can narrow the source. I would eternally grateful to any kind soul wishing to assist me in these trying times.","3024":"\nThere's a local hotspot that takes orders until 12:30 AM called [Big E's pizza](http:\/\/bigepizza.com)! It's currently 11:22 PM so this is the only reason I mention that.. I'm not sure if anywhere else is still open. We're gonna be playing video games for the next 24 hours and thought some pizza pie would be cool. \n\nWoo!","3025":"No sob story here, just a hungry guy after work. I've got a pretty big craving for some pizza but trying to save cash for when I head up to school again in the fall. Any of you guys want to help a dude out?\n\nC:","3026":"Is anyone out there kind enough to help me out? I started a new job Monday (in this day and age, I consider this a win) but won't get paid until the 15th. Spent all my graduation money on the deposit for my apartment near work. I am hungry and can show my pathetic empty fridge and equally pathetic bank account with $1.97 in it. Just throwing this out there if anyone has the heart to help a dude out. If so, I promise to help out another in need on the 15th when I receive my paycheck. Thanks for reading anyway.","3027":"Have today off, soo I'll be stuck in the house all day cleaning and doing homework that I've put off for a week... Just looking for a pizza pie for lunch! :) \n\nEDIT: Welp, got hungry and finished my homework, so I ordered Jimmy Johns instead, maybe next time! :) ","3028":"I've never done anything like this before, but I am willing to try this out. I am the proud mother of an awesome toddler whose favorite food is pizza. Today is the first day of our staycation, but I am poor until Friday when I get paid. Hoping to make my little man smile by having some pizza for lunch","3029":"Like the title says, had to pay an unexpected bill that I was going to pay this coming Friday on payday. We thought we had until friday but it turns out that we didn't. Wasn't able to buy food for us this week in trade of having gas to get to work.
