Also being a broke college student means either this or stale cereal.","17":"","18":"Just a normal guy here that is low on cash (no more then $30 to last me the rest of the month) and is craving some pizza.\n\nSince I'm in Sweden it might be a bit tricky but I do have a paypal account. I've been thinking about buying someone a pizza here for a while and I'll be sure to return the favor as soon as I get my paycheck :).\n\nCheers guys.","19":"I've been hit hard with medical bills, insurance bills, and utilities, resulting in becoming completely broke.  If someone was willing to send a pizza my way it would go a long way, I'd make make whatever sent last for at least a week or more.  If anyone can help that would be most awesome and I'd try my best to help others on here when I financially can.","20":"So I had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and I stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading. \n\nHe took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.\n\nToday I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. \n\nAlso being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge\/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. \n\nTL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To \"protect\" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.\n","21":"This sub reddit is awesome","22":"Hey all.  My wife is away on business tonight, so it's just me an my daughter.  Well, had an unexpected bill come out of my checking account today putting me in the negative.

I'll repay the kindness for sure.\n\n","23":"I'm broke until Thursday and pretty hungry. Any pizza received will be paid forward, promise.

(YIKES) Could anyone please help me out tonight? I get paid friday and would be able to pay the randomness back.... Thank you","25":"Some help please? I do have more ramen and pasta. Just want a delectable pie instead with a twist on the process.\n\nI have been here before and have made requests. My one caveat is that I can pay the willing giver back with a pizza when I get paid. In this case it will be this Friday.\n\nHowever this time I want to do something different. I want to either pay it forward to a person of the givers choice with an included explanation as to why the person deserves a pie, or by giving me an explanation as to why you have decided to give to me a pie.\n\nI want to do it this way to provide some entertainment for the sub, and so this doesn't look like just another desperate request. I look forward to your stories and reasoning.","26":"hi im a 45 yr disabled mom and grandma living on my ssi check , i do not get my fs til the 4th of october my check goes completely to bills any help with  a pizza request would be so appreciated im new on here ,we are a family of  3 adults and a teenager and am 8 yr.old  im in lowell massachusetts","27":"","28":"I'm a U.S. history major that would love a pizza to help get me through this long day of studying ahead. ","29":"So, about a 2 months ago, I found a job. It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.\n\nI also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.\n\nAnd then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.\n\n(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) \n\nMy boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.\n\nSo, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.\n\nSorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(\n\nTL;DR: Broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway. Would love pizza. Would also love to give pizza when I can afford it.","30":"My son will be 1 on Friday. He does eat pizza and anything else dont worry because he has 10 teeth.

Only have like 3 cans of tuna, couple packs of ramen and like a decent amount of pb&amp;j but like 2 slices of bread left and some kraft singles. Should be enough to keep me fed until I can access my funds but a pizza this weekend would really let ration what I have left in case I have to wait a full 14 days. Tallahassee Florida, FSU student. Parents will not help (as usual) they said if I need money ill have to wait 3 weeks. You don't understand how much I would appreciate this.","35":"Being poor sucks.

I had some cheese, bacon, a hamburger bun, and a salad. Currently, I'm training for my new job and am finding it hard to focus without bringing lunch for my very full day. If I had a nice, hot, gooey pizza for dinner and lunch tomorrow, I'd be set. Pizza Hut has nice deals going on. Buy me a pizza and I will trade you a body\/hygiene\/cosmetic product from my future store (You can message me if you want to know what store that is, but it is a really awesome one). Thank you.","37":"Our roommates are all out of town, and a pizza to snack on during our movie night would be great.

In and out of various jobs, we've had to survive off of coscto sized ramen packs, and pasta and olive oil.  I applied for food stamps a couple days ago, and am waiting to hear back from them.  It's getting a little trite, and we're quite hungry tonight, a hot pizza would be a delight.  We'll happily pay it forward in the future.  Much love.","43":"Well to cut to the chase I am living with HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyapthy) and I have been having some trouble breathing lately.  Being uninsured, I go to the urgent care center and the doc tells me that I suffered a mild heart attack sometime last week.  It hit me kind of rough because I haven't had an episode in years and I've been really healthy. All my family is 8+ hours away and to be honest it feels good to just tell someone in general.  \n\nAnything reassuring would really boost my spirits\/confidence in the matter if only an 'it's going to be ok.'  Thanks in advance and once my spirits pick up, I promise to pay it forward.","44":"I'm currently sitting at work with an empty stomach and an emptier bank account. I'm struggling to stay afloat, but a full docket of bills and college expenses have me running thin this month.

So, my oldest is almost 9. She came down with strep three days after school started back. Yay. =\\ Had a semi stressful weekend with trying to keep her and my youngest (almost 11 months) apart so the youngest wouldn't get infected too. However, the baby woke me up at 2am yesterday morning with a faucet for a nose and a slight cough. Called the doctor to see if that warranted a visit, and low and behold it does. She was also positive for strep. She's a really good baby though, and except for being off her bottle (I guess the sucking hurts?) a little bit, and hating to have her nose wiped, she's dealing amazingly well. \n\nSo to sum it up, I've got two sick kids and I'm behind on household chores (anyone got a laundry fairy they can spare??) and I'd really just like a night off from cooking dinner. I'm not desperate for food, and I totally understand if there are others who are and you'd rather help them. \n\nWe're in Metro Atlanta, and are happy with any of the three major chains, but we also have Hungry Howies and Bucks pizza who both have online ordering. My oldest only eats cheese, and I'll take any meat product on the other side.

But that doesn't even start until...later &gt;_&gt;\n\nAlright so my life isn't that bad. But seriously though can I please have a pizza?

No one is needy\/broke etc, I just wanted to start of a chain of action from our Table Top Adventurers. :)\n\n**Edit: I have no idea how to clarify that this is no longer needed since the time past.

I was injured during this last crab season and am told I won't be able to fish again because of it. I'm pretty bummed and broke. I could sure use a pizza.","91":"These are the reasons we NEED pizza:\n\n1. One of our roommates is lost in a storm and we would like her to have some melty, tomatoey, cheesy goodness when (if) she survives and makes it back to our dorm.\n2. One roommate is banging her head on her desk and if we had a pizza it would be a good cushion so she wouldn't hurt her head.\n3. Our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them.\n4. One roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. Probably to keep from crying. We think pizza would help.\n5. This same roommate just announced that she had to fart. We need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste.\n6. Lucy is lost.\n7. We can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either).\n8. I just needed to have one more reason so that our list would have an even number of reasons because odd numbers are gross.\n\nPeace and blessins'\n","92":"Southeast Michigander here. We're a couple living together in a small home on have been on a single income for nearly four months now. My S\/O just got a new job but there wont be a paycheck for a couple of weeks. I've been floating us by but we're both college students too so it's not like we had any sort of saving to speak of :p. \n\nAnyway, we were hoping for a ROAP with an absolute promise to pay it forward times two this upcoming Friday. We've nothing but soup and green beans in the pantry! (Although green beans are damned delish aren't they? Just not very filling. :D)\n\nThanks for hearing me out &lt;3 ","93":"Hey Reddit, I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.\n\nBut now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.\n\nI rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.\n\nIt's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.\n\nI must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to \"pay-it-back\" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).\n\n\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\n*","94":"I've been without a job since the middle of August, so I've been living off of what's been left of my savings account. I've been living off of bagels and yogurt for the past month or so, and I really want a pizza to liven things up (and it'll feed me both tonight and tomorrow, too). As a college student who doesn't have a meal plan, this would mean a lot to me.\n\nI'll gladly pizza you (or someone else on this subreddit, if you want) at an equal value at a later date, once I get a job and my first paycheck. I'm hearing back from an interview later this week, so it could be pretty soon that I pizza you back.\n\nThank you for reading, and I'd love to be able to give to this subreddit once I have money.","95":"My school is opened these last two days (Monday and Tuesday) for finals even though a lot of people had most of theirs last week. My friend and I have an exam on Tuesday, so we haven't been able to go home early. But what I don't get is why all the food shut down without a prior notice. I've been living on meal swipes this semester, but now their useless and I'm broke, so no going out to eat. I just need a pizzaaaa.","96":"Hey there guys I was just flicking through random subreddits and I stumbled on this! Well you probably get starving students all the time I guess. I'm a second year at Otago uni but I'm still only 17, meaning I live on the unsupported child benefit instead of the Student Allowance. After rent and power I have 70$ per week to live on (that's NZD too); the thing is I brought two 16$ posters for my room in my new flat (kinda a mistake) and now I'm kinda starving. Been eating nothing but noodles and these cheap (disgusting) beef patties all week. \n\nSo yeah I'd appreciate a pizza SO MUCH! I'd be willing to post a funny pic or whatever if that's what people usually do here? cheers guys!","97":"As the title mentions.

I have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when I don't talk to at least one of my siblings via Steam or Facebook. I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.\n\nTheir financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general.

I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.\n\nA little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.\n\nThe job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.\n \nI did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.\n\nWhile working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).\n\nWhile I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.\n\nThere I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,\n\nA month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.\n\nSee family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!\n\nJuly 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.\n\nOh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!\n\nCan reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? \n\nI can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.\n\n  ","285":"**Miami, FL**\n\nI've never tried this RaoP before, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

I've been craving pizza for the past few days, but I haven't been able to buy any because of the financial aid office holding out on student grants\/loans.

The year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.\n\nI was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. My annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and I was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. The annual leave payout was a lot less than I anticipated, as I was taxed a lot, meaning I could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. I made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and I put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since. \n\nMy car rego is now overdue, I have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when I run out of petrol (I have about half a tank at the moment) I have no idea how I'm going to get to and from uni, and I have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on Friday. Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.\n\nThe reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again. Not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.\n\nPlease help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night.

I heard about this site on the radio, and I thought it was the nicest idea. I have been on both sides of this. Able to give, and in need.

So he has been pounding the pavement trying to find a new job, and in the meantime my salary gets stretched pretty thin. We use to have pizza night on Friday with the kids. We'd get a movie from the Redbox, enjoy a pizza pie and have a fun family night. Its amazing how you miss simple things like that. I hope we are soon in a position again where we can give more, and need for less. Heck, I hope we all are. Times are just hard, jobs are scarce and I just hope things get better for everyone.

(Specifically The Soulard Area)\n\nSo here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..\n\nFor the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery.\nAt one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors)\nThings were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.\nWell. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.\n\nShe had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.\n\nSo here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house.\nBUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong.\nSo i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of..\nThanks in advance.\n\nTLDR; Living Life Like a boss, then old warrant came up, Lost everything because of bad decisions in the past.. pizza will help morale.","555":"So I have 23 papa points on my papajohns.com account.

My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are \"resealing\" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.

Just today, I filled up what would be my last bowl to be ready to end the day. Of course, something happened, I found a beetle on my cereal, I had taken multiple spoonfuls at this point and didn't notice it. Did I mention I was terrified and grossed out of bugs? My only option was to through out the cereal, it took me some guts to even drink the milk at the end. (Didn't want to waste it) I live with my parents, and I have to drive a 1989 Lincoln Town Car to college every day. I can barely afford to pay for the gas every 5 days to go to and from school. All in all I'm starving, trying to finish my homework for the day. Some pizza would be awesome at this point. \n\n**Beetle Picture**\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TWdXh.jpg","668":"I had applied for this job that would have been perfect for me.  My current job is so stressful it puts me in tears every other week, and with Christmas coming it is just bound to get worse.  I went in and interviewed and they said they would talk it over.  They hadn't expected to hire anyone but my application had skills on it that are just rare and they could use.  (i worked in an engraving\/framing shop, and they have an engraving part to their store)\n\nTurns out though that my available hours just aren't what they're looking for.  I can either compromise my study time for school to take this job, causing me school stress, or i can stay at my already shitty place but not have school stress.  Either way, stress.\n\nSo i'm bummed, and could really use a pizza.  Or better yet, subway, since i'm supposed to be on a diet\/making a life change.  But today i just don't care as much about that as i should.  Between finding that out, and my desktop computer with all my awesomeness not turning on yesterday, my thanksgiving break has just been shit.   \n\n(No idea what's wrong with the computer.  it's getting power, but when it turns on it sounds like eight hundred fans turn on inside, and it never goes to a login screen.  I don't know enough about computers to fix it. That was usually the ex-husbands job)\n\nlong story short, my computer is broke, and i didn't get a job that would have made my life hella easier.

I would love whoever could hook us up with a pizza please. I start on Monday and won't get my first check for at least 3 weeks. \n\nI've been so down in the dumps wondering where my next meal would come from or how I would even get it. I've come from having a furnished living space to bare walls and a dream of being able to support myself again. I thought about committing suicide because I just couldn't see any end in sight to this. \n\nI want to thank my friends who stood by me and helped me in my search. A pizza can't repay them for all they've done, but it's definitely a start. If you're in the Santa Fe area, you are more than welcomed to join us. I hope someone can help me do something nice for my friends. Thank you.","672":" My sister and I haven't had a decent meal for the past 2 weeks due to our sick parents who lives in the Philippines.

So, things are bad: I'm waiting on help from my relatives to pay rent (late) and utilities (also late). My girlfriend and I haven't been able to find work and are having a very hard time making ends meet. The power was shut off this morning, and we don't have enough money to get it turned on--or any food that doesn't require cooking.\n\nI'm looking into getting help from relatives sooner rather than later on the power bill, but I don't know exactly when that's going to happen. At this point, I'd judge this request to be more of a need than a want. \n\nFull disclosure: We've gotten pizza through RAOP twice. Once was through a request a few weeks ago, and the other was a totally unsolicited offer after my girlfriend got into a conversation with someone here. Both times we were a bit better off than we are now, but we didn't have much to eat in the house and we couldn't afford the pizza ourselves. \n\nOh, I should mention--I have a battery backup that's giving us Internet access at the moment. It'll be out of juice sometime today, so we'll either use the last of our batteries to use a nearby wireless network or head to the library. \n\nThanks for staying with me through this wall of text. \n\nEdit: Girlfriend said I should offer proof as there's been a lot of fake requests and offers here lately. We can give you a picture of the shutoff notice, or something like that. Reply or send a PM.","676":"Hi all, \n\nWe just moved across Canada and are moving into our new place here in Edmonton, Alberta. Long story short, the movers completely botched our move and we are not getting our property for another week. The move has been tough on us financially and emotionally, we could use a break. Wondering if anyone out there wants to send some pizza over our way. We will return the favour in two weeks once we get settled into our new place.","677":"Basically, a year ago I bought a computer using a credit card offered with a 0% introductory APR for a year. Buried in the fine print was a line explaining that I would be charged 22.9% interest on my initial purchase if I didn't pay in full after 12 months. I didn't realize that bit until yesterday, the one-year anniversary of my purchase (I posted a whole thread about the episode elsewhere). The result - a surprise $500 charge to my card.\n\nAnd of course all of this happened when my payment plan failed as a result of my financial aid being literally obliterated this year. The state decided to take my grant offers away.\n\nSo that was just really rough. I feel awful and scared and screwed and I have no idea how I'm going to to get out of this debt any time soon. Doesn't help that I was planning to go to grad school next year. No idea how that will work out now.\n\nSo I'd like some pizza to dull the pain. It would literally mean an absolute ton to me right now.

My dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. He came home for a half hour and he said I can't leave the house because I have SATs tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. When he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. I just checked my wallet and I remembered I just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on Steam last night and I'm kind of regretting that now. Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.\n\nTL;DR: Grandpa and my mom are in the hospital.

Not only that, but it looks like the lay-off might have been a blessing in disguise, because this job seems amazing!\n\nUnfortunately, I don't get paid for a while. While I have some left-overs I could eat, I'd love to be able to celebrate with a delicious pizza! (And of course, the first new paycheck will have me celebrating again by paying the pizza-giving forward!)\n\nThanks, everyone!","727":"I had no idea this subreddit existed. Very cool stuff.\n\nAnyway, I'm supposedly going to start working an on-campus gig for the University of Arizona soon, but the person responsible for the job has been dragging their feet hardcore. Bank account is in the shit, I don't own any credit cards, and the only thing I have in my house is a can of tuna. I don't even like tuna.\n\nProbably not as deserving as a single mom, but college kids gotta eat, too! And if you're a local I will take you out for a drink once I start working :)","728":"Hi Everyone!\n\nFirst time requester here and thanks for reading. I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)\n\nAbout 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.\n\nAfter about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. \n\nIt's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. \n\nBy the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).\n\nI met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. \n\nFor his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.\n\nSo, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. \n\nI hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. \n\nFast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.\n\nI try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.\n\nOne day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http:\/\/imgur.com\/SoygY","729":"As the title says, there isn't much going on here in Cary this Sunday for me.

He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.

I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325\/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.\n\nI've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.\n\nAlso, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.\n\nSo here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.\n\nNOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)\n\nEDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.\n\n","785":"My gf of 4 years and I just broke up and i'm trying to do any random thing that might help slowly fill the void. Unfortunately I was unprepared for this and it has cost me quite a bit already.

You all have saved me in so many ways, but this is my first time asking for a real life helping hand. Thank You!","806":"Its been a while since I've been on a site where random people can get together and contribute something real.  I miss the days when Bots in a chat room (that most people goto irc doesn't count, those bots are friendly) were a minority, . \n\nMyself and room mates do a lot of donation of our time and limited resources, helping those less fortunate that showed up at the Occupi.  \nWhen we have an abundance we try to make the trickle down thing work, but it is tough to do with food, preparing, freshness...\n\nThe local Z-Pizza is good.  1 roommate is vegetarian, and 1 is vegan.

My parents won't be able to give me money for a while. Can someone please help me with one of those EGIFT cards people give out? I can make some pizza last. I love Domino's. It's around the corner and the closest to me. So, hopefully when i wake up tomorrow I'll have some comments and a pizza by tomorrow night. ","936":"I am a student looking for gastric entertainment.  If you are interested in offering a pizza, I will gladly accept and thank you graciously.  I will also gladly place an offer post when student loans are distributed (last week of August).  Need info?  PM me!  Thank you for your consideration.  P.S. I did the verification system.","937":"College student and I've lived mostly off of rice, oatmeal and a starbucks gift card I found in my apartment for the past 2 days. I could really use something more substantial but true to undergraduate form I'm out of cash right now. A delicious meat and veggie topped pizza would really hit the spot. If I'm honest I could bum some sandwich money off a roommate and overall I'm hardly in dire straits but I'm sick of hitting my friends up for minor things. Just a college student with a stomach that's as empty as his wallet. I'd love a pizza to study with tonight and to eat cold for breakfast tomorrow morning.","938":"I'm going to keep this as short, but still have it make sense, as possible.\nI intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.\n\nSo I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this.\nI get there and everything is fine for about a day.\nHe decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.\n\nThe next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. \n\nI'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. \n\nI'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.\nI don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can.\nI'm in the eastern PA area. \nThanks for any help any one can give, it won't be forgotten and will definitely be paid forward.\n\nTL;DR Moved out to PA from NV, was told I had a job, didn't, grandfather went all schizo on me, now I'm staying in a run down trailer behind my uncles friends house, waiting for the paper work for my car so I can scrap it and go back home.\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/Hah9o","939":"It's just me tonight.. my kiddos are gone for the night and i would really like to enjoy a pizza i haven't been on in awhile due to very rude people so i'm just asking if you are not gonna say anything nice and you only want to talk negative then pass this up and don't post because you are wasting your time being negative. no sob story or nothing just hungry with a night to myself. thanks RAOP!! :)","940":"Due to some error at work which was found too late for anything to be done about it, I won't be getting paid until mid January.

In addition to smashing almost all the glass and beating the sides with what we believe was a golf club, they also stole my SO's suits which were in the backseat.  While we noticed several of these fine citizens sporting some ill fitting business attire, we chose not to approach.  We found the backseat around 50 yards away, but decided to leave that behind as well since a couple of very friendly men were in the process of making it their fuck pad.  Everything that could physically be taken was, but they left us something in return!  They took a big poop in the trunk!  Alas we miss the Mitsubishi Lancer, and the only thing that could possibly dissipate our grief is a delicious hot pizza.  \nCan provide pictures of car as well as pictures of our really cute dog.\n\nThank you to fordgawn for the delicious Bacon Pizza!!!!","946":"I've been debating whether to post here or not, because I am just beyond shocked.

I don't know what to tell the wife as I've been at the computer most of the day trying to take my mind off of it while looking for work. I'm hoping she will take the news as best as she can over a good meal. We're not without food, but I know that she loves pepperoni and mushroom pizza. \n\nWhat's left in the bank and what's coming in the next check will all go to bills, so I really have no way of treating her to her favorite. I've worked hard to provide for my family, but I feel like less of a man when I can't. I'm hoping someone can help me treat my wife to her favorite and that she will handle the situation well.

I don't have any meal plans left for the semester (ends Monday the 19th), and I can basically only feed him a sandwich or Cheerios. It would be awesome if someone could help out. I just spent all of my money on my monthly bills and books for next semester. Please and thank you!\n\nEDIT: I can verify that I'm human or whatever.
